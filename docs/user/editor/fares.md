# Fares

## Fares Overview

### Fare attributes

Fare attributes describe the basic information about a fare including the price, currency type and transfer information. See the [GTFS specification fare attribute reference](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#fare_attributestxt) for more information.
### Fare rules

Fare rules describe how much riders pay to use a transit system, based on factors such as distance traveled, time of day, and type of fare media used (such as a mobile app). In other words, they govern how fare attributes are applied. See the [GTFS specification fare rule reference](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#fare_rulestxt) for more information.


## Editing/Creating Fares

### Edit fare attributes
In the `Attributes` tab, required and optional information about the fare can be entered, like `fare_id`, `price` and `currency_type`.

**Note: Be sure to click the save button (ðŸ’¾) after changes to fare attributes or fare rules are made. Clicking save after adding attributes will allow you to edit fare rules.**

### Edit fare rules

To define fare rules, you must first create fare zones, which are explained in the next section.

To edit fare rules, you must first create and save a fare with attributes. After choosing a fare, click the `Rules` tab and define one or more rules for this fare using the following types:

1. **Route** - applies to any itinerary that includes the route
2. **From/to zone** - applies to any itinerary that travels from the origin zone to the destination zone
3. **Contains zone** - applies to any itinerary that passes through *each* `contains` zone

### Creating fare zones

To create a fare zone, you must first select a stop that you would like to include in the zone by clicking the location pin icon on the sidebar and selecting one of the stop names. Next, click in the `zone_id` dropdown and begin typing the new `zone_id`. Click `Create new zone: [zone_id]` and then save the stop. Repeat for as many zones as needed.
