      planning or in other applications."

    tooFewTimepoints: "You must have more than 1 timepoint to interpolate times"
    usageExplanationOne: This feature is useful when the travel times for one or more
      pattern stops change. Take for example a pattern
      that has been re-routed along to travel a longer distance, has had a
      stop added (or removed), or has had a layover introduced mid-trip.
      Once you have adjusted the travel times to account for these changes,
      you can normalize the stop times to bring them into alignment with the
      updated travel times reflected in the pattern stops.
    usageExplanationTwo: Interpolating stop times calculates the implicit speed between timepoints
      based on the shape distance and the default travel times. This speed is
      then applied to the shape distance traveled for each intermediate non-timepoint
      stop to provide interpolated travel times. The default travel time for non-timepoint
      stops will not be modified.
    usageNotes: " Usage notes"
  NormalizeStopTimesTip:
    info: "Tip: when changing travel times, consider
    using the 'Normalize stop times' button above to automatically update
    all stop times to the updated travel time."
